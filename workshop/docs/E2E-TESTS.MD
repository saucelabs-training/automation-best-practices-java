# E2E Tests

## Review test strategy

[Let's review our testing gaps](TEST-STRATEGY.MD) 

## Covering business risk

We can use **functional e2e UI** tests to cover some of the risks

## 🏋️‍♀️Write tests using best practices

1. Go to `com.saucedemo.exercises.E2ETests.java` and finish all of the tests.
2. Run each test to make sure they work
3. At the end, run all tests with `mvn test -Dtest=E2ETests`


**Rules**

✅ Use page objects

✅ One test for one feature

❌ Don't create any new code, simply reuse existing code
